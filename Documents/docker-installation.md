## I. DOCKER INSTALLATION
This tutorial heavily relies on elastic search's docker containers. To get that running, install Docker Desktop. You can download the installer from this [link](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). This is your gateway to **building your containerized Elastic Stack**.

Once you have it installed, open Docker Desktop, and go to settings. Go to Resource and set memory to about 4GB Ram. Our elastic stack container is a bit of a resource hog, so we'll expand Docker's capacity. This will prove helpful later once we start inserting our Data.

With the Ram changed and Docker Desktop running, you're now ready to move forward to build your own container.
