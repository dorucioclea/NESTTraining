## VII. USING THE SEARCH
As part of the solution, we also prepared a fully useable web application that utilizes our elastic search server. To get this running, open the solution NuSearch.sln again on Visual Studio 2019.

Set the startup project to NuSearch.Web. This is the web application's code. Build this and Run. You should now see the Search Webpage.
